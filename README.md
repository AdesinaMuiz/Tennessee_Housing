This SQL code is a journey through data cleaning and exploration.

The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning, including standardizing date formats, populating missing values, and splitting address information.
Filtering: Irrelevant records are filtered out based on null values in specific columns. This leaves us with a clean dataset ready for analysis.
Exploration: Several insights are derived.
Seasonal Patterns: We investigate whether there are seasonal patterns in house listings and sales by counting the number of sales per month.
Total Sale Revenue: The code calculates the total sale revenue for each year, giving us insights into annual sales trends.

# Insights
The analysis reveals significant variations in property sale prices across different cities. Some cities consistently command higher prices, while others have more affordable properties. This information can be valuable for real estate investors and homebuyers.
The data shows that there are seasonal patterns in house listings and sales. This information can be crucial for both buyers and sellers, as it suggests that the timing of listing or buying a property can influence prices.

The market showed impressive growth with revenue increasing by approximately 25.85% and 19.43% year-over-year, indicating a thriving market. However, 2016 witnessed a downturn with a -6.52% decline. An anomaly in 2019 resulted in a shocking drop.

# Limitations
While a deeper investigation could shed light on this anomaly, it's important to highlight that the dataset contained a substantial number of null values. Given the extensive presence of these null values, it was evident that the data appeared to be incomplete and potentially inconsistent. To ensure a robust analysis, the decision was made to filter out incomplete records, allowing for a more focused examination of the available data and its broader trends. It doesn't delve into advanced predictive modeling or external factors influencing property prices

# Conclusion
This project showcases the power of SQL in handling real-world data. It reinforces data cleaning skills ,offers a comprehensive view of the dataset's characteristics and provides actionable insights for various stakeholders in the real estate market.
